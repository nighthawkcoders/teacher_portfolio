### Platforms and Walls
Make a lesson and code around jumping onto platforms, and jumping over walls.  There were a lot of challenges with Platform and how it stops/interacts with Gravity.  Altering techniques used could be part of the investigation.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by the Teacher project. 

Provided is the code for Platform.js, JumpPlatform.js, BlockPlatform.js.   These all inherit properties from the GameObject class.  Review logic to detect when the player interacts with the platform.

Use platforms to avoid enemies or obtain points by capturing coins, etc.  There could be advancements like floating platforms.
