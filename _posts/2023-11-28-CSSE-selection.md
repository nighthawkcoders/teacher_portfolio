## Player Selection Screen
Make a lesson and code around Player preferences.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by Teacher project. 

Pick your Player.  Look into a technique to change players from default Mario Sprite to alternate Sprite.  Save the Player to personal settings.

Sprite Selection
- Create a sprite selection screen where players can choose their character.
- Save the selected sprite in local storage for continuity.
Customizable Controls

Other Settings
Add settings or controls to the game
- Allow the player to select elements to change power or capabilities in game.
- Allow players to define or redefine key mappings for movements (like arrow keys, spacebar)
