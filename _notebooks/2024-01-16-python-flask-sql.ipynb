    "## Database and SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This section introduces the use of SQLAlchemy with a SQLite database to demonstrate how programs interact with data, emphasizing the iterative, interactive nature of processing information and managing data using classes and tables. It aligns with the College Board's emphasis on program usage, managing data, insight, filter systems, and application in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports and Flask Objects\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The imports initialize the Flask app and SQLAlchemy, which are essential for creating a web application connected to a database.\n",
    "### Flask app object\n",
    "This is the core of the Flask application, used for handling web requests.\n",
    "### SQLAlchemy db object\n",
    "This is the core of the ORM, used for database interactions in an object-oriented manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class User and db.Model Inheritance\n",
    "This is where the User model is defined, inheriting from db.Model of SQLAlchemy, which facilitates database operations in an object-oriented way.\n",
    "### Init Method and Property Decorators\n",
    "The init method sets up the initial state of the User object, while @property and setter methods define how to access and modify the object's attributes.\n",
    "### CRUD Methods\n",
    "Methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database are defined here, making use of SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities for streamlined database interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inital Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function initUsers\n",
    "This function initializes the database and populates it with test data using User model instances. The use of try/except blocks ensures graceful handling of errors, such as duplicate data.\n",
    "Check for Given Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fuctionality\n",
    "The find_by_uid function retrieves a user from the database based on the unique identifier, while check_credentials validates user credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQLAlchemy Use\n",
    "Utilizes SQLAlchemy's query-building methods for efficient database searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a New User\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "The create function demonstrates adding a new user to the database, showcasing input handling, object initialization, and error management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Creation Logic\n",
    "Involves checking for existing users, handling date inputs, and using the custom create method of the User model for database insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Users Table\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "The read function uses SQLAlchemy's query.all method to retrieve all users from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Formatting\n",
    "Implements list comprehension to format the user data into a JSON-friendly structure, making it easier to handle in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks (Suggestions for Extension)\n",
    "### Persionalization\n",
    "Encourages reader to implement these examples in their own projects, adapting and expanding upon the CRUD fuctionality.\n",
    "### Enhancements\n",
    "Suggests adding update and delete functionalities to provide a comprehensive undetstanding of CRUD operations in a databsae context"
