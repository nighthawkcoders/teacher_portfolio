These Fall 2023 numbers reflect the usage of cloud computers.  For the year we have had 43 users, 34 remain active.  Cloud computing requests have been both temporary and permanent.\n",

    "`Cloud Computing`  Traditionally, classrooms have been serviced by on premise desktops; costs can be high, and the aging of machines can be rapid. The purpose of this project is to create workspaces, similar to laptops/desktops, but in the cloud. The students would use their District issued Chromebook to access these cloud workspaces, which would enable them to perform coding work in their Computer Science Pathway.   The early cost number analysis has indicated that this could be much more affordable in a 5 year cycle, plus aging amd maintenace of equipment is now outsourced to the cloud provider.  \n",
