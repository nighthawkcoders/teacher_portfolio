    "- IOC-1.C.1 - Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries.\n",
    "- IOC-1.C.2 - The \"digital divide\" refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics.\n",
    "- IOC-1.C.3 - The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals.\n",
    "- IOC-1.C.4 - The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally.\n",

    "## What is the Digital Divide? \n",
    "You could probably infer what it might be, but here it is anyway. The Digital Divide is the divde of multiple peoples, and their access to internet. These difference could be based socioeconomically, geographically, or demogrpahically. \n"

    "## Why do these things happen?\n",
    "Since everyone comes from differnet, socioeconomic, geographic, and demogrpahic background, different people live different lives.\n",
    "#### Three main factors:\n",
    "Socioeconomic - refers amount of money that comes into the household, and if people can afford to buy devices to connect to the internet\n",
    "Demographic - refers to the Age and Religion of a person, as those factors could limit people’s knowledge and understanding around computers\n",
    "Geographic - refers to where you are, and how much internet access you can get by being in a certain place. Some places are bustling cities with multiple opporitunities to connect to the internet, and others are deserted islands. They have different amounts of accesible internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "So therefore:\n",
    "Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries.\n",
    "The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals.\n",
    "The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally.\n",
    "The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In some countries:\n",
    "- Computers are not that common in rural areas\n",
    "- Only a small number of websites\n",
    "- The Internet is used to protect and advocate the government\n",
    "- There is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government\n"

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Taiwan is known to have the highest internet speed in the world. When compared with Brazil, Taiwan is tiny. There would need to be more physical infrastructure to cover all that area, hence Brazil has a pretty slow internet speed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Tonga is a nation of 76 islands in the Pacific, and it had very slow internet speeds until 2013 when a 514-mile-long fiber cable was installed. Unfortunately, it was severed by a ship, which cut off access for 12 entire days.\n",

    "Difficult Terrain\n",

    "Internet Black Holes\n",

    "Internet Shutdowns\n",
    "In 2019, Iran shut down access to the Internet after there were protests about high gas prices. The network connectivity in Iran was about 5% for five days.\n",

    "\n",
    "Teledensity and land area being pervided by CIA Factobook and World Bank for GDP\n",
    "\n",
    "Benin: Benin has a teledensity of <1 per 100 people, along with a GDP of 1.96 billion and a land area of 110,622 sq km\n",

    "France: France 110 per 100 people along with a GDP of 1270 billion and a land area of  640,427 sq km\n",

    "Taiwan: Taiwan has 120 phones per 100 people and 116.62 billion by Statista and a land area of 32,260 sq km\n",
    "\n",
    "Not to get into colonization, because I am not going to give you a conclusive overview of how that plays out to Benin or other African countries yet this could be a contributing factor, so please research this if you want to learn more about this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though to leave this onto a happier note, here’s what’s being done about in Rwanda. Their Broad Band Internet is connecting more people to have a 90 to 100 person ratio of internet access. According to a branch of the UN, this is allowing people to more easily access banks because a click of a button is easier than a several mile journey to the bank. Along with this according to the accompanying report in 2018 outlines how OECD countries (except Japan) have plans on how they would implement broadband access to these countries. \n"
