    "Variables are considered abstraction as they assign a value to another value. In other words, they basically describe values to each other. Variables are important as it can be used in many different uses such as they can store useful information, especially if you have a long lines of code. Variables are mostly used to store data such as numbers (we are going to go over integers today), booleans, lists, strings and dictionaries.  \n",

    " * highScore is a better and shorter way of saying highestScoreInTheGame\n",

    "\n",
    " * instead of is raining (because it has spaced) israining or is_it_raining is a better way of looking at the variable\n",
    "\n",
    " * phonenumber is better than saying 555-number (it just looks neater to look at)"

You can also create your own data types using classes. This is called data abstraction. Here is an example of data abstraction: \n",
