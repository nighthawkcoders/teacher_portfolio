    "###   Post Correspondence Problem\n",
    "The Post Correspondence Problem (PCP) involves a set of tiles, each containing two strings. The problem asks whether it is possible to arrange these tiles in a sequence (repetitions allowed) so that concatenating the top strings of the selected tiles matches the concatenation of the bottom strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "###   Tiling Problem\n",
    "The Tiling Problem deals with determining whether a given shape (arbitrary shape) can be tiled using a finite set of smaller shapes (tiles). It remains undecidable due to the infinite possibilities and arrangements of shapes that would need to be considered to conclusively solve the problem.\n",

    "###   Word Problem for Groups\n",
    "The Word Problem for Groups asks whether, given a group presentation and two words formed from the group's generators, these words represent the same group element. This problem cannot be solved algorithmically due to the undecidable nature of the word problem for groups in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "###   Busy Beaver Problem\n",
    "The Busy Beaver Problem involves finding the Turing machine with the most significant number of steps executed before halting among all machines with a certain number of states. Due to the vast number of possible configurations and the infinite potential for different Turing machines, determining the Busy Beaver function for a given number of states remains undecidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "###   Collatz Conjecture\n",
    "The Collatz Conjecture follows an iterative sequence for positive integers: if the number is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, triple it and add 1. The conjecture posits that regardless of the starting number, this sequence always reaches 1. Despite extensive computational verifications, a proof for all integers remains undetermined.\n",

    "###   Post's Correspondence Problem\n",
    "Post's Correspondence Problem (PCP) involves choosing sequences of pairs of strings from a finite set so that the concatenation of the first string in each pair matches the concatenation of the second string.

    "\n",
    "###   Rice's Theorem\n",
    "Rice's Theorem states that any non-trivial property about the behavior of programs that can be determined by examining their source code is undecidable. It asserts that it's impossible to create a general algorithm to decide non-trivial semantic properties of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "###   Emptiness Problem for Turing Machines\n",
    "The Emptiness Problem for Turing Machines aims to determine whether a given Turing machine recognizes any strings in its language. This problem is undecidable since determining whether a Turing machine halts on all inputs (recognizes no strings) is equivalent to solving the Halting Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "###   The Entscheidungsproblem\n",
    "The Entscheidungsproblem refers to David Hilbert's problem of finding an algorithm to decide the truth of any mathematical statement by creating a mechanical procedure for solving mathematical problems. This problem was proven undecidable by Turing, Church, and others in their work on computability theory and the limitations of computation."
