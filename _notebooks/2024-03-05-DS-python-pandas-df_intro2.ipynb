    "The purpose is to obtain a basic understanding of working with a dataset, using Pandas dataframes. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of Pandas capabilities, research operations such as filtering data based on certain criteria, grouping data, or performing calculations on multiple columns.  Additional work can be done with these Python modules (ie numpy, matplotlib). \n",

After showing each operation in a separate code block, add a sentence explaining what that operation is showing and what real-world implication it has. It is important to make sure that you are not only able to run code to analyze data, but also understand its implications.\n",
