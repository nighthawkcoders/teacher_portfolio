    "## Introduction to State Machines \n",
    "\n",
    "State machines, also known as finite state machines (FSMs) or finite state automata (FSAs), are mathematical models of computation used in computer science, linguistics, and related fields. They are abstract machines that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### States\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a game, a state could represent the status or condition of a game character at a given time. For example, `state.animation` could represent the current animation state of a character, such as 'idle', 'walk', 'run', or 'jump'. Similarly, `state.collision` could represent the current collision state of a character, such as 'floor', 'wall', or 'jumpPlatform'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitions are the rules or conditions that dictate when and how a state machine can move from one state to another. In a game, a transition could be triggered by a user action (like pressing a key), a timer, or a change in game conditions (like a collision with another object).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are the behaviors associated with a particular state. When a state machine enters a state, it might perform an action associated with that state. For example, if a character enters the 'walk' state, the action might be to start the walking animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a game, state machines can be used to manage game logic, character behaviors, animations, and more. They provide a structured way to handle the complex, dynamic conditions that can arise in a game."

    "## The role of states in game logic \n",
    "Based on various factors, some synchronous and some asynchronous, the game states will change. JavaScript objects have been created to track these specific states. Finite state game logic is used to process these states as the game loop proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of collision finite state logic. This logic handles collisions between the player and other game objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "switch (this.state.collision) {\n",
    "    // 1. Player is on a jump platform\n",
    "    case \"jumpPlatform\":\n",
    "        // Player is on top of the jump platform\n",
    "        // ... code\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    // 2. Player is on or touching a wall \n",
    "    case \"wall\":\n",
    "        // Player is on top of the wall\n",
    "        // ... code\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    // 3. Player is in default state\n",
    "    case \"floor\":\n",
    "        // Player is on the floor\n",
    "        // ... code\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of animation finite state logic. This logic sets the sprite animation frame based on the player's current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "switch (this.state.animation) {\n",
    "    case 'idle':\n",
    "        this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.idle[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    case 'walk':\n",
    "        this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.walk[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    case 'run':\n",
    "        this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.run[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    case 'jump':\n",
    "        this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.jump[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        console.error(`Invalid state: ${this.state.animation}`);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "The code below shows how objects can be changed to create a different state in the game. Be sure to review PlayerBase.js for the actual finite state game logic."
