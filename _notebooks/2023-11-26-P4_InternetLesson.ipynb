    "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

    "<br>![Layer 1](https://www.ad-net.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Layer-1-1.jpg)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Layer 1 is how devices transmit information to each other (ethernet, network adaptors)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we send information, we send it \"physically\" hence the name physical layer\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we send information, we send it in binary, frames are the units of binary data, they are the information we send from one device to another (in the same network network)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if i want to send the message \"Hello\" to my brother on the same network, the frame will be sent within the network to the corresponding MAC address(Media Access Control) address, sometimes referred to as a hardware or physical address, is a unique, 12-character alphanumeric attribute that is used to identify individual electronic devices on a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frames can only be sent on the same network\n",
    "\n",
    "A switch is a fundamental networking device that operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to connect devices within the same local area network (LAN) and facilitate communication between them. Here's how switches work and why they are crucial in network setups:\n",

    "\n",
    "If I wanted to play Valorant with a friend, I would need to connect to the WiFi, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike frames, my friend is not on the same network as me, which means MAC Addresses aren't enough to locate the device so they cannot communicate with eachother\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to identify Hanlun Li on a specific network, how do we do that? IP addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "IP Addresses are supposedly a unique identifier for each device on the network, to access a seperate device on the network, we must give a destination IP address. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packets are basically just frames, but with an IP address included in them\n",

    "![Layer 4](https://www.colocationamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/udp-tcp.jpg) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer 4 has two protocols UDP and TCP, you can think of it as UDP you just spam packets to the other network without acknowledgement whereas TCP you need to acknowledge everything sent to the other network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, TCP is slower but more reliable, while UDP is faster but less reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm sending an important email to my boss, I would use TCP because I wouldn't want the data to be corrupted or lost.\n",

    "3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**\n",
