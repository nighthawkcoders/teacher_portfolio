    "The internet was originally created for scientists to easily share information remotely without needing to send or receive mail from one another. Nowadays, many people use the internet more than they sleep, as the internet has become an integral part of our lives in many ways.

These make us want to seek out these feelings more and more and experience those seconds of happiness. These effects of the internet lead to people having major issues like sleep deprivation, depression, and anxiety.\n",
