    "## What is a Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's clarify what a database is and go over the most popular ones for different applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "A database which most of you should know is just a place to store data. Some popular databses for diffrent types of programs include . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "A type of relational database that uses a structured query language for defining and manipulating data. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MySQL:** A widely used open-source relational database management system.\n",
    "- **PostgreSQL:** Known for its extensibility and support for advanced data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Databases for Application Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "In application development, NoSQL databases are often favored for their flexibility and scalability. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MongoDB:** A document-oriented NoSQL database, ideal for handling JSON-like documents.\n",
    "- **Cassandra:** A distributed NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of data across commodity servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Databases for Web Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web development often involves databases that can efficiently manage dynamic content and user interactions. Two popular choices are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Firebase:** A cloud-based platform that includes a real-time NoSQL database, suitable for building web and mobile applications.\n",
    "- **SQLite:** A lightweight, embedded relational database often used in web development due to its simplicity and portability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These databases cater to various needs in the development landscape, providing developers with options based on the specific requirements of their projects. Whether it's relational databases for structured data or NoSQL databases for flexibility, the choice of a database depends on factors such as data structure, scalability, and the nature of the application being developed.\n"

It's like a form we fill out for every user, and the User model helps us keep everything neat and organized.\n",

So, when a new user signs up, SQLAlchemy helps us save their info in the database.\n",
