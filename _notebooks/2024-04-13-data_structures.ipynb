    "## Properties and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties**: These are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**: These are actions that can be performed on objects. A method is a property that contains a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider an object representing a person:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let person = {\n",
    "    firstName: \"John\",\n",
    "    lastName: \"Doe\",\n",
    "    age: 50,\n",
    "    fullName: function() {\n",
    "        return this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, firstName, lastName, and age are properties, while fullName is a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to access properties and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties and methods of an object can be accessed using ***dot notation*** or ***bracket notation***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dot notation\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Property\n",
    "objectName.propertyName \n",
    "// Method\n",
    "objectName.methodName()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bracket notation\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Property\n",
    "objectName[\"propertyName\"]\n",
    "// Method\n",
    "objectName[\"methodName\"]()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example using person object\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// To access the firstName property of the person object\n",
    "// Dot Notation Property\n",
    "person.firstName\n",
    "// Bracket Notation Property\n",
    "person[\"firstName\"]\n",
    "// Dot Notation Method\n",
    "person.fullName()\n",
    "// Bracket Notation Method\n",
    "person[\"fullName\"]()\n",
    "```\n",
