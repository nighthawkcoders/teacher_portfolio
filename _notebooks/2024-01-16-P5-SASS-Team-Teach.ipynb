    "\n",
    "**What is Sass?**  \n",
    "Short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, SASS is a popular CSS pre-processor. SASS code is processed by the program and compiled into CSS code, which can be used to style HTML elements. SASS controls how it appears on the web page. It is compatible with all CSS versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SCSS vs CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is CSS?**  \n",
    "CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). For example, it is used to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is SCSS?  \n",
    "It is basically more advanced than CSS. SCSS assists a user in adding various extra features to the CSS, such as nesting, variables, etc. These extra features make the process of writing the SCSS language quicker and easier as compared to that of writing the standard language of CSS."

    "## Nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting is a way to organize code for better readability. It involves placing one selector inside another.\n",
    "In regular CSS, SASS helps organize code. Avoid excessive nesting to prevent overqualified selectors that can be challenging to read and maintain.\n"

    "## Benefits of SASS over traditional CSS\n",
    "- **Improved code organization:** SASS offers enhanced code organization through features like nested rules and modular imports, promoting a more structured and readable stylesheet.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** SASS facilitates easier maintenance with variables, mixins, and functions, reducing code redundancy and making updates and changes more efficient.\n",
    "- **Advanced features:** SASS provides advanced features such as variables, mixins, inheritance, and logic operators. This allows for more dynamic stylesheets than CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modular SCSS\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Modular SCSS enables you to divide your SCSS files into several pieces and compile them into a unified CSS file. \n",
    "- add an underscore (_) before the filenames.scss \n",
    "- import it into your file without the underscore, and all the styles will come along\n",
    "- using a partial is that it allows you to break down the code for multiple components in larger websites\n",
    "- ll the styles in the partial will be included and can be used in the main file as if they were originally defined in the main file itself\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Variables:\n",
    "A variable is essentially a container that stores a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance in SASS:\n",
    "In SASS, utilizing variables allows for the convenient reuse of a value throughout the stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbol in Sass:\n",
    "The $ symbol is employed in Sass to signify and designate a variable"
