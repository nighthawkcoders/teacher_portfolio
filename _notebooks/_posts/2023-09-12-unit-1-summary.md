## Make a Video as a Team
Test will be conducted by creating a video.  Make sure video has segments with transition pages.  Have each member of Agile Team in at least 1 segment.  Edit video effectively and try to keep it under 4 minutes.  The video can instruct user to pause and interact with a Jupyter Notebook, this does not count against video time.

### Collaboration Review
It is a common belief in industry that collaboration is one of the key skills of a Software Engineer.  Simple activities like think-pair-share, agile methodolgoy, and making and reviewing plans are consider fundamental in speeding up the development life cycle.  An Agile mindset and checking in with other often is fundamental.  Remember, "collaboration" is the 1st topic in AP Classroom, first usually means important.

- [ ] What are the benefits of a team?  Explain some of the diveristies that your team has to offer.
- [ ] Describe how you will facilitate communication amongst group members.
- [ ] How will you hold each person accountable for their portion of the work?  Think about dates, review tickets, and peer revies. 

### Program Function and Purpose
To "make" a program with function and purpose, you need to "plan" a program with function and purpose.  Build a Jupyter Notebook to show examples of the following.

- [ ] Program with Output
- [ ] Program with Input and Output
- [ ] Program with a List
- [ ] Program with a Dictionary
- [ ] Program with Iteration
- [ ] Program with a Function to perform mathematical and/or a statistical calculations.
- [ ] Program with a Selection/Condition
- [ ] Finish with a Program with Purpose

### Program Design and Development
Share a program that you have expanded upon that was written by another.  Show extensive documentation on that program (ie use ChatGPT for help).  Here are some minimum requirements for Design and Development documentation.

- [ ] Create a Visual Illustration of a program, algorithm, ot process.
- [ ] Show documentation of a program with a List and Iteration.
- [ ] Show comments on a program that does a mathematical and/or statistical calculation.

### Identyfing and Correct Errors
Often, when we develop code the initial functionality is very simple.  However, when we consider invalid conditions when using our code we often increase the complexity of our code or functions.

- [ ] Create a tester function that runs a program and validates its functionality.
- [ ] Show comments and code logic that reduces errors in code with if / else statements.
- [ ] Show comments and code logic that reduces errors in code with try / catch statements.
