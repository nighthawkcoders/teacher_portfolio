## Teaching Requirements
Each team will give a 10 minute lesson and assign 30 minutes of homework to introduce their unit.  Make sure lesson has the following...
- Lesson describes Purpose and Objectives from AP
- Review of Unit Materials and Videos from AP Classroom
- Key Vocabulary
- Key Coding requirements, share by interactive coding challenges during lesson
- Highlight any Tricks or Gotchas from Unit, could be added to coding challenge
- Assign homework to re-informce lesson, 48 hours to complete.
- Have a grading plan on homework and publish results 48 hours after due.

## List of tech terms required
> A big emphasis on learning Units #1-#10 is learning vocabulary.  ***Be sure to incorporate all of these terms into your units as applicable.***  Don't just have a list of definitions.  It is best if vocabulary is incorporated within working code, ie Jupyter Notebooks.
